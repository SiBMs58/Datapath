Welcome to the Logistics Software! This software package allows you to simulate and analyze logistics operations using electronic circuit files (.circ) and a provided script called Test.py. Please follow the instructions below to install the software and load the required files.

## Installation

To install and run the Logistics Software, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

 - Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org.
Once you have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
  - git clone <git-url>
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
  - cd Datapath 
3. Install the required Python dependencies:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. The software is now installed and ready to use.

## Loading Circuit Files

To load the SD_Group32.circ file and simulate the path, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the SD_Group32.circ file available on your machine. If not, obtain the file from a reliable source.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the Logistics Software.
3. Run the following command to execute the simulation using Test.py:
- python Test.py -f -t <test-file> -c SD_Group32.circ
Replace <test-file> with the name of the test file you want to use for the simulation.
4. The simulation will start, and the software will attempt to recognize the components in the SD_Group32.circ file. However, if some components are not recognized, you may need to load additional .circ files to provide the necessary components.
5. If prompted for missing components, locate the corresponding .circ files and load them into the simulation using the appropriate command or flag.
6. Continue the simulation, and the Logistics Software will analyze the logistics path based on the loaded files.

## Usage

Once you have successfully loaded the circuit files and started the simulation, you can interact with the Logistics Software to analyze the logistics path and evaluate its performance. The specific features and functionalities of the software will depend on the implementation and design of the Test.py script.

Please refer to the documentation or user manual provided with the Logistics Software for detailed usage instructions and information on available commands, options, and output formats.
